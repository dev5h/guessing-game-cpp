# A NumberGuessing Game in C++

### Message:
- Beginner Friendly C++ Practice
- Made for a beginner level practice with C++
- Created in 10 mins by Shazin
- Any beginner fork it

**Possible suggestions to extend the idea:**
- Randomize the maximum and minimum range.
- Create a Python bot to play with it.
- Add detailed hints like when someone guesses a value `output: very near`
- Add a challenge to finish the game in specific number of attempts
- Set dynamic move limitations based on the complexity level
- Store the scores in a plain text later to use it.

Good Luck (y)
